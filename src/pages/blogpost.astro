        <p>Scattered across Copenhagen, the same small mosaic of Greenland appears in different locations. The image is always identical: a simplified outline of Greenland, placed quietly into the urban landscape. There is no signature, no explanation and no official context attached to the work. This repetition and anonymity are central elements of what is known as the Landic Project.

The identity of the artist behind Landic Project remains unknown. Over the years, there have been speculations suggesting a possible connection to the late Greenlandic-Danish artist Pia Arke — potentially her son — though this has never been confirmed. The lack of a known author leaves the project open to interpretation and places the focus not on the artist, but on the symbol itself.

Personally, I began noticing these mosaics around 2010, though they may have existed earlier. Encountering the same image repeatedly across the city creates a sense of quiet insistence. The mosaics do not demand attention, yet once noticed, they are difficult to ignore. Their presence raises questions: Why is Greenland here? Why in this form? And why without explanation?</p>

<h2>Street Art: more art or activism?
</h2>
<p>Landic Project can be understood as a form of subtle public intervention. By placing a recognisable symbol of Greenland into everyday urban spaces, the project invites passers-by to reflect on Greenland’s presence within Danish society — historically, culturally and politically. The repetition of the same motif reinforces this presence, making it feel persistent rather than decorative.

One possible intention of the project is to create awareness and encourage curiosity about Greenland and Greenlandic culture. Instead of offering direct answers, the mosaics function as prompts — an invitation to learn more, to question assumptions and to seek knowledge beyond surface-level representations.

Within this context, Landic Project may also be interpreted as a response to racism and prejudice directed towards Greenlanders. By embedding Greenlandic identity into the cityscape without explanation or apology, the project asserts presence and visibility. It challenges the invisibility and stereotypes that Greenlanders often face, and instead places Greenlandic identity firmly within public space.</p>

<p>As a creative travel experience, Landic Project offers an alternative way of exploring Copenhagen. Rather than visiting official cultural institutions, the viewer encounters culture unexpectedly — through walking, observing and paying attention to details. This aligns closely with how many young creatives engage with cities today: through curiosity, visual discovery and reflective encounters.

Landic Project does not explain itself. It simply exists. And in doing so, it opens space for dialogue, interpretation and awareness.

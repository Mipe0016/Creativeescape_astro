        <p>Born in Nuuk in 1994 Nina grew up in Greenland, where her early creative practice was rooted in movement and dance before she began working with photography and performance.


Her work often explores the unequal relationship between Western culture and Indigenous culture. Through photography, performance and text, Sikkersoq examines questions of identity, representation and power, drawing on both personal experience and collective histories. Themes of displacement, visibility and resistance recur throughout her practice.

<h2>art or activism?
</h2>
<p>Art and activism are closely connected in Sikkersoq’s work. She is engaged in broader struggles for justice and solidarity and works from the belief that liberation is collective — that none of us are free until all of us are free. This perspective shapes both the subjects she addresses and the way she positions her work in public and institutional spaces.</p>

<h2>Take over</h2>

<p>As part of Creative Escape, Nina Sikkersoq takes over the platform through a curated artist takeover. The takeover consists of an introductory post followed by three thematic posts that present selected works and reflections from her practice. Rather than functioning as a portfolio, the takeover offers a personal and situated perspective, allowing the artist’s voice to lead the narrative.

The artist takeover unfolds on Creative Escape’s Instagram and forms part of the project’s wider exploration of culture, identity and alternative ways of experiencing place.
